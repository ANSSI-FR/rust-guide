# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in this project. Please read this document
carefully before considering any contributions.

At this time, this guide is intended to be a living document. It still lacks
important points and details, and future versions of the language and compiler
may render some recommendations obsolete. We are eager to discuss and to receive
contributions from anyone who is aware of common or uncommon pitfalls to avoid,
or good coding practices and tools that can help building more robust software
with the Rust language.

Thus, feel free to create pull requests to suggest recommendations or
modifications, or to submit an issue to start discussions. Specifically, please
opt for a *pull request* for small changes like:

- complementing a paragraph,
- adding a small example in the form of code snippet,
- updating some information
- fixing typos and English mistakes,
- etc.

and for an *issue* in case of more substantive changes:

- suggesting a new recommendation,
- discussing controversial points,
- rewording a consistent part of the text,
- etc.
