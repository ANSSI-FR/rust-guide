## Forget and memory leaks

While the usual way for memory to be reclaimed is for a variable to go out of
scope, Rust provides special functions to manually reclaim memory: `forget` and
`drop` of the `std::mem` module (or `core::mem`). While `drop` simply triggers
an early memory reclamation that calls associated destructors when needed,
`forget` skips any call to the destructors.

```rust
let pair = ('â†‘', 0xBADD_CAFEu32);
drop(pair); // here `forget` would be equivalent (no destructor to call)
```

Both functions are **memory safe** in Rust. However, `forget` will make any
resource managed by the value unreachable and unclaimed.

```rust
# use std::mem::forget;
let s = String::from("Hello");
forget(s); // Leak memory
```

In particular, using `forget` may result in not releasing critical resources
leading to deadlocks or not erasing sensitive data from the memory. That is why,
`forget` is **unsecure**.

> In a secure Rust development, the `forget` function of `std::mem`

The standard library includes other way to *forget* dropping values:

- `Box::leak` to leak a resource,
- `Box::into_raw` to exploit the value in some unsafe code, notably in FFI,
- `ManuallyDrop` (in `std::mem` or `core::mem`) to enforce manual release of some value.

Those alternatives may lead to the same security issue but they have the
additional benefit of making their goal obvious.

`ManuallyDrop` and `Box::into_raw` shift the release responsibility from the
compiler to the developer.

## Uninitialized memory

By default, Rust forces all values to be initialized, preventing the use of
uninitialized memory (except if using `std::mem::uninitialized` or
`std::mem::MaybeUninit`).

> **Rule {{#check MEM-UNINIT | Do not use uninitialized memory}}**
>
> The `std::mem::uninitialized` function (deprecated 1.38) or the
> `std::mem::MaybeUninit` type (stabilized 1.36) must not be used, or explicitly
> justified when necessary.

The use of uninitialized memory may result in two distinct security issues:

- drop of uninitialized memory (also a memory safety issue),
- non-drop of initialized memory.

> **Note**

> Indeed, it makes dropping uninitialized values a lot more difficult.
> However, it does not change the second issue: the non-drop of an initialized

> the use of `Drop` to erase sensitive memory.

## Secure memory zeroing for sensitive information

Zeroing memory is useful for sensitive variables, especially if the
Rust code is used through FFI.

> **Rule {{#check MEM-ZERO | Zero out memory of sensitive data after use}}**
>
> Variables containing sensitive data must be zeroed out after use, using
> functions that will not be removed by the compiler optimizations, like
> `std::ptr::write_volatile` or the `zeroize` crate.

The following code shows how to define an integer type that will be set to
0 when freed, using the `Drop` trait:

```rust
/// Example: u32 newtype, set to 0 when freed
pub struct ZU32(pub u32);

impl Drop for ZU32 {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("zeroing memory");
        unsafe{ ::std::ptr::write_volatile(&mut self.0, 0) };
    }
}

# fn main() {
{
    let i = ZU32(42);
    // ...
} // i is freed here
# }
```
