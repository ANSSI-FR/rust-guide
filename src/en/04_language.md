# Language generalities

## Naming

As of now, the standard library is the de facto standard for naming things in
the Rust world. However, an effort has been made to formalize it, first in
[RFC 430], then in the [Rust API Guidelines].

The basic rule consists in using :

- `UpperCamelCase` for types, traits, enum variants,
- `snake_case` for functions, methods, macros, variables and modules,
- `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for statics and constants,
- `'lowercase` for lifetimes.

The [Rust API Guidelines] also prescribes more precise naming conventions for
some particular constructions:

- (C-CONV) for conversion methods (`as_`, `to_`, `into_`),
- (C-GETTER) for getters,
- (C-ITER) for iterator-producing methods,
- (C-ITER-TY) for iterator types,
- (C-FEATURE) for feature naming,
- (C-WORD-ORDER) for word order consistency.

## Integer overflows

Although some verification is performed by Rust regarding potential integer
overflows, precautions should be taken when executing arithmetic operations on
integers.

In particular, it should be noted that using debug or release compilation
profile changes integer overflow behavior. In debug configuration, overflow
cause the termination of the program (`panic`), whereas in the release
configuration the computed value silently wraps around the maximum value that
can be stored.

This last behavior can be made explicit by using the `Wrapping` generic type,
or the `overflowing_<op>` and `wrapping_<op>` operations on integers
(the `<op>` part being `add`, `mul`, `sub`, `shr`, etc.).

```rust
use std::num::Wrapping;
# use std::panic;

# fn main() {
let x: u8 = 242;

# let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
println!("{}", x + 50);                      // panics in debug, prints 36 in release.
# });
# if result.is_err() { println!("panic"); }
println!("{}", x.overflowing_add(50).0);     // always prints 36.
println!("{}", x.wrapping_add(50));          // always prints 36.
println!("{}", Wrapping(x) + Wrapping(50));  // always prints 36.

// always panics:
let (res, c) = x.overflowing_add(50);
# let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {
if c { panic!("custom error"); }
else { println!("{}", res); }
# });
# if result.is_err() { println!("panic"); }
# }
```

## Error handling

<!-- <mark>TODO</mark>: explicit good practices in error handling. -->

The `Result` type is the preferred way of handling functions that can fail.
A `Result` object must be tested, and never ignored.

> **Recommendation {{#check LANG-ERRWRAP | Implement custom `Error` type, wrapping all possible errors}}**
>
> A crate can implement its own `Error` type, wrapping all possible errors.
> It must be careful to make this type exception-safe (RFC 1236), and implement
> `Error + Send + Sync + 'static` as well as `Display`.

> **Recommendation {{#check LANG-ERRDO | Use the `?` operator and do not use the `try!` macro}}**
>
> The `?` operator should be used to improve readability of code.
> The `try!` macro should not be used.

Third-party crates may be used to facilitate error handling. Most of them
(notably [failure], [snafu], [thiserror]) address the creation of new custom
error types that implement the necessary traits and allow wrapping other
errors.

Another approach (notably proposed in the [anyhow] crate) consists in an automatic
wrapping of errors into a single universal error type. Such wrappers should not
be used in libraries and complex systems because they do not allow developers to
provide context to the wrapped error.

### Panics

Explicit error handling (`Result`) should always be preferred instead of calling
`panic`.  The cause of the error should be available, and generic errors should
be avoided.

Crates providing libraries should never use functions or instructions that can
fail and cause the code to panic.

Common patterns that can cause panics are:

- using `unwrap` or `expect`,
- using `assert`,
- an unchecked access to an array,
- integer overflow (in debug mode),
- division by zero,
- large allocations,
- string formatting using `format!`.

> **Rule {{#check LANG-NOPANIC | Don't use functions that can cause `panic!`}}**
>
> Functions or instructions that can cause the code to panic at runtime must not
> be used.

> **Rule {{#check LANG-ARRINDEXING | Test properly array indexing or use the `get` method}}**
>
> Array indexing must be properly tested, or the `get` method should be used to
> return an `Option`.

<!--
<mark>TODO</mark> Check if the [no_panic](https://github.com/dtolnay/no-panic)
crate can catch all cases. Drawback: all functions need to be marked as
`#[no_panic]`.

### FFI and panics

When calling Rust code from another language (for ex. C), the Rust code must
be careful to never panic.
Stack unwinding from Rust code into foreign code results in undefined behavior.

> **Rule {{#check LANG-FFIPANIC | Handle correctly `panic!` in FFI}}**
>
> Rust code called from FFI must either ensure the function cannot panic, or use
> `catch_unwind` or the `std::panic` module to ensure the rust code will not
> abort or return in an unstable state.

Note that `catch_unwind` will only catch unwinding panics, not those that abort
the process.
