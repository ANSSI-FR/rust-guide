# Development environment

## Rustup

[Rustup] is the Rust toolchain installer. Among other things, it enables
switching between different flavors of the toolchain (stable, beta, nightly),
managing additional components installation and keeping them up to date.

### Rust Editions

Several flavors, called *editions*, of the Rust language coexist.

The concept of editions has been introduced to clarify new features
implementation and to make them incremental. A new edition will be produced
every two or three years, as stated in the [Edition Guide], but this doesn’t
mean that new features and improvements will only be shipped in a new edition.

Some editions bring new keywords and language constructs. Recommendations for
secure applications development then remain closely linked to features of the
language, that are used in such applications, rather than to Rust editions.
In the rest of this guide, best effort will be made to highlight constructions
and language features that are specific to a particular Rust edition.

> **Note**
>
> No specific edition is recommended, as long as users follow the
> recommendations related to the features offered by the edition that has been
> chosen.

### Stable, nightly and beta toolchains

Orthogonally to editions that allow one to select a flavor (a set of features)
of the Rust language, the Rust toolchain is provided in three different
versions, called *release channels*:

- *nightly* releases are created once a day,
- *beta* releases are created every six weeks, from promoted *nightly* releases,
- *stable* releases are created every six weeks, from promoted *beta* releases.

When playing with different toolchains, it is important to check not only what
the default toolchain is, but also if overrides are currently set for some
directories.

```shell
$ pwd
/tmp/foo
$ rustup toolchain list
stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
beta-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
$ rustup override list
/tmp/foo                                    nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
$
```

> **Rule {{#check DENV-STABLE | Use a stable compilation toolchain}}**
>
> Development of a secure application must be done using a fully stable
> toolchain, for limiting potential compiler, runtime or tool bugs.

When using a specific `cargo` subcommand that requires a nightly component,
it is preferable to run it by switching the toolchain only locally, instead
of explicitly switching the complete toolchain. For example, to run the
(nightly) latest `rustfmt`:

```shell
$ rustup toolchain list
stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
beta-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
$ rustup run nightly cargo fmt
$ # or
$ cargo +nightly fmt
$
```

## Cargo

Once Rustup has set up the appropriate Rust toolchain, [Cargo] is available
through the command line program `cargo`. Cargo is the Rust package manager.
It has a fundamental role in most Rust development:

- It structures project by providing the project skeleton (`cargo new`),
- It compiles the project (`cargo build`),
- It generates the project's documentation (`cargo doc`),
- It runs tests (`cargo test`) and benchmarks (`cargo bench`),
- It manages and download dependencies,
- It makes packages distributable and publishes them on [crates.io],
- It’s also a front-end to run complementary tools such as those that are
  described below, in the form of sub-commands.

Cargo enables automatic dependencies resolution before compilation 
by checking their checksums.
File `Cargo.lock` contains all dependencies checksums which are compared to
the one downloaded.
If a difference is detected, compilation fails:

```
error: checksum for `sha256 v1.6.0` changed between lock files

this could be indicative of a few possible errors:

    * the lock file is corrupt
    * a replacement source in use (e.g., a mirror) returned a different checksum
    * the source itself may be corrupt in one way or another

unable to verify that `sha256 v1.6.0` is the same as when the lockfile was generated
```

When the `Cargo.lock` file is missing, it is generated on first build and records the
dependencies' checksums, adhering to a TOFU (*Trust On First Use*) policy.
This file can also be created manually with `cargo generate-lockfile`. If it already exists,
the file is overwritten with the latest available version of every crate.

> **Rule {{#check DENV-CARGO-LOCK | Track Cargo.lock in version control system}}**
>
> `Cargo.lock` files must be tracked by version control system.

<div class="warning">

**Warning**

Ongoing discussions occur on how to best protect
and verify crates *on their first download* (according TOFU rule).
For now, the security of the first download relies on the good security of the
website [crates.io] and the GitHub hosted repository containing the
registry index. In some cases, it may be preferable to opt for an alternative
installation method for dependencies.

</div>

Cargo proposes many different commands and options to adapt the build process to
your project needs, mainly through the manifest file `Cargo.toml`. For a
complete presentation, see [The Cargo Book].

During the development of a secure application, some of the options may require
some attention. The `[profile.*]` sections allow configuring how the compiler is
invoked. For example:

- the `debug-assertions` variable controls whether debug assertions are enabled,
- the `overflow-checks` variable controls whether overflows are checked for
  integer arithmetic.

Overriding the default options may cause bugs not being detected, even when
using the debug profile that normally enables runtime checks (for example
[integer overflow checks](./04_language.html#integer-overflows)).

> **Rule {{#check DENV-CARGO-OPTS | Keep default values for critical variables in cargo profiles}}**
>
> The variables `debug-assertions` and `overflow-checks` must not be overridden
> in development profiles sections (`[profile.dev]` and `[profile.test]`).

Cargo proposes other ways to setup its configuration and change its behavior on
a given system. This can be very useful, but it may also be difficult to know
and remember at a given time all the options that are effectively used, and
in particular passed to the compiler. At the end, this can affect the confidence
and robustness of the build process. It is preferable to centralize compiler
options and flags in the configuration file `Cargo.toml`. For the case of
environment variable `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, for example, that may be used to generate
part of code or to run external tools before Rust compilation, it is preferable
to use the Cargo build scripts feature.

> **Rule {{#check DENV-CARGO-ENVVARS | Keep default values for compiler environment variables when running cargo}}**
>
> The environment variables `RUSTC`, `RUSTC_WRAPPER` and `RUSTFLAGS` must not
> be overriden when using Cargo to build the project.

### Clippy

[Clippy] is a tool that provides and checks many lints (bugs, styling, performance
issues, etc.). Since version 1.29, `clippy` can be used within the stable
`rustup` environment. It is recommended to install `clippy` as a component
(`rustup component add clippy`) in the stable toolchain instead of installing it
as a project dependency.

The tool comes with some lint categories regarding the kind of issues it aims to
detect. The warnings should be re-checked by the programmer before committing
the fix that is suggested by `clippy`, especially in the case of lints of the
category `clippy::nursery` since those hints are still under development.

> **Rule {{#check DENV-LINTER | Use linter regularly}}**
>
> A linter, such as `clippy`, must be used regularly during the development of
> a secure application.

### Rustfmt

[Rustfmt] is a tool that formats your code according to style guidelines. The
documentation of the tool states some limitations, among others partial support
of macro declarations and uses. One should use the `--check` option that prints
proposed changes, review these changes, and finally apply them if the code
readability is not affected.

So, to launch it:

```shell
$ cargo fmt -- --check
$ # review of the changes
$ cargo fmt
```

These guidelines can be customized to your needs by creating a `rustfmt.toml` or
`.rustfmt.toml` file at the root of your project. It will be used to override
the default settings, for instance:

```toml
# Set the maximum line width to 120
max_width = 120
# Maximum line length for single line if-else expressions
single_line_if_else_max_width = 40
```

For more information about the guidelines that `rustfmt` will check, have a look
at the [Rust Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/style-guide/index.html).

> **Rule {{#check DENV-FORMAT | Use Rust formatter (rustfmt)}}**
>
> The tool `rustfmt` can be used to ensure that the codebase respects style
> guidelines (as described in `rustfmt.toml` file), with `--check` option and
> manual review.

### Rustfix

Included with Rust, since the end of 2018, [Rustfix] is a tool dedicated in
fixing compiler warnings as well as easing transitions between editions.

```shell
$ cargo fix
```

To prepare a Rust 2015 project to transition to Rust 2018, one can run:

```shell
$ cargo fix --edition
```

Rustfix will either fix the code to be compatible with Rust 2018 or print a
warning that explains the problem. This problem will have to be fixed manually.
By running the command (and possibly fixing manually some issues) until there
is no warning, one can ensure the code is compatible with both Rust 2015 and
Rust 2018.

To switch definitely to Rust 2018, one may run:

```shell
$ cargo fix --edition-idioms
```

Be advised that this tool provides few guarantees on the soundness of the
proposed fixes. In particular mode, some corrections (such as some of those
provided with the `--edition-idioms`) are known to break the compilation
or change the program semantics in some case.

> **Rule {{#check DENV-AUTOFIX | Manually check automatic fixes}}**
>
> In a secure Rust development, any automatic fix (for instance, provided by
> `rustfix`) must be verified by the developer.

### Others

There exist other useful tools or `cargo` subcommands for enforcing program
security whether by searching for specific code patterns or by providing
convenient commands for testing or fuzzing. They are discussed in the following
chapters, according to their goals.
