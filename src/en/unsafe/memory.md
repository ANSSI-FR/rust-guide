In the vast majority of cases, in non-`unsafe` Rust (i.e., code that does not use `unsafe`), the compiler **automatically** determines when it can release the memory occupied by a value in the program.
But, as [noted earlier](04_language.md#rust-guarantees), this is not
a guarantee: code without `unsafe` can still lead to memory leaks. Therefore, some of the
rules presented in this chapter are not strictly related to the `unsafe` keyword. However,

## `forget` and memory leaks

While the usual way for memory to be reclaimed is for a variable to go out of
scope, Rust provides special functions to manually reclaim memory: `forget` and
`drop` of the `std::mem` module (or `core::mem`). While `drop` simply triggers
an early memory reclamation that calls associated destructors when needed,
`forget` skips any call to the destructors.

```rust
let pair = ('â†‘', 0xBADD_CAFEu32);
drop(pair); // here `forget` would be equivalent (no destructor to call)
```

Both functions are **memory safe** in Rust. However, `forget` will make any
resource managed by the value unreachable and unclaimed.

```rust
# use std::mem::forget;
let s = String::from("Hello");
forget(s); // Leak memory
```

In particular, using `forget` may result in not releasing critical resources,
leading to deadlocks or not erasing sensitive data from the memory. This is why
`forget` is **unsecure**.

The standard library includes other way to *forget* dropping values:

- `Box::leak` to leak a resource,
- `Box::into_raw` to exploit the value in some unsafe code, notably in FFI,
- `ManuallyDrop` (in `std::mem` or `core::mem`) to enforce manual release of some value.

Those alternatives may lead to the same security issue but they have the
additional benefit of making their goal obvious.

`ManuallyDrop` and `Box::into_raw` shift the release responsibility from the
compiler to the developer.

## Raw pointers

These pointers are mainly used for C pointers. They do not have the same protections
as *smart pointers* and often have to be used in `unsafe` context. For instance, freeing 
raw pointers must be done manually without Rust guaranties.

> ```

The converse is also true! That is, `from_raw` should be call **only** on `into_raw`ed value. For instance,
`Rc` smart pointers [explicitly request for this condition](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/struct.Rc.html#method.from_raw)
and, for `Box` smart pointers, conversion of C pointers into `Box` is [discouraged](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html#memory-layout).

> **Rule {{#check MEM-INTOFROMRAW | Call `from_raw` *only* on `into_raw`ed value}}**
>
> In a secure Rust development, `from_raw` should only be called on `into_raw`ed values.

> **Note**
>
> In the case of `Box::into_raw`, manual cleanup is possible but a lot more

> let p = Box::into_raw(x);
> unsafe {
>     ptr::drop_in_place(p);
>     dealloc(p as *mut u8, Layout::new::<String>());
> }
> ```
>
> Because the other types (`Rc` and `Arc`) are opaque and more complex, manual
> cleanup is not possible.

## Uninitialized memory

By default, Rust forces all values to be initialized, preventing the use of
uninitialized memory (except when using `std::mem::uninitialized` or
`std::mem::MaybeUninit`).

> **Rule {{#check MEM-UNINIT | Do not use uninitialized memory}}**
>
> The `std::mem::uninitialized` function (deprecated 1.38) must never be used.
> Each usage of the `std::mem::MaybeUninit` type (stabilized 1.36) must be explicitly
> justified when necessary.

The use of uninitialized memory may result in two distinct security issues:

- drop of uninitialized memory (also a memory safety issue),
- non-drop of initialized memory.

> **Note**

> `std::mem::MaybeUninit` is an improvement over `std::mem::uninitialized`.
> Indeed, it makes dropping uninitialized values a lot more difficult.
> However, it does not change the second issue: the non-drop of an initialized

> the use of `Drop` to erase sensitive memory.

## Cyclic reference counted pointers (`Rc` and `Arc`)

Combining [interior mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/interior-mutability.html), recursivity and reference counted pointer into type definitions is unsafe. It can produce memory leaks which can result in DDoS attacks or leaking secrets.

The following example shows such a memory leak in safe Rust:

```rust
use std::{cell::Cell, rc::Rc};

struct LinkedStruct {
    other: Cell<Option<Rc<LinkedStruct>>>,
}

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    let a = Rc::new(LinkedStruct {
        other: Cell::new(None),
    });
    let b = Rc::new(LinkedStruct {
        other: Cell::new(None),
    });
    let aa = a.clone();
    let bb = b.clone();
    a.other.set(Some(bb));
    b.other.set(Some(aa));
}
```

Memory leak is shown with `valgrind`:
